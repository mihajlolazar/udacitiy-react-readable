This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for Frontend and with [Udacity Readable API Server](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter) for Backend.
The whole installation process ia actually very simple. 

For Backend:
  - `git clone https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter`
  - `cd reactnd-project-readable-starter/api-server`
  - `npm install`
  - `node server`

For Frontend:
  - `create-react-app frontend`
  - `cd frontend`
  - `npm start`
  
  
If everything went well, your browser should open a React page with sample data.
